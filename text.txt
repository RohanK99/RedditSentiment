Do you have any single monitor versions? 
Single Screens are up. Some how I broke AttackChoppers, but added one. Let me know if you have issues. 
Anyone in particular?
Resolution?
I think I built out single screens of those. I will have to gather what I have and post tomorrow. 

Get back to me,

I'm interested in all 3, actually. I installed the others that you posted here. I really liked the 2am one. Neurofibres was good, too. I have a 1080p monitor.

Added links, 
Enjoy.. 
Good bot  
Ok, I downloaded them. Strangely, they work when i click on the application, but when I put them in the windows system 32 folder and try to start them with the screensaver launcher, I get an error message. Weird. Well, anyways, I really like the crow one! 
64bit or 32bit windows?

64bit = C:\Windows\SysWOW64------
32bit = C:\Windows\System32

If you have x64 and you put the files in System32, it will throw an error. (Remove files)

Notes: Resolution change and quality settings.
Double click the (xxx.scr) and Alt immediately after will bring up the settings menu. Only need to set it one time or till happy with results. After that , just set the screensaver the normal windows way.  
Yeah, that did the trick. Works perfectly now. Thanks! I look forward to the Attack Choppers one! 
I will put it up this weekend.
Thank you,
Enjoy..
