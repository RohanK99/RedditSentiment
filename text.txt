The person chasing after is what really does it for me. 
When you want to leave work early on Friday but your boss ain't having it 
“Lalalalalalala” 
“Take me with you” -Bulldog inside the glass room  
"Call the cops. I don't give a fuck." 
Omg I smiled so hard at this 
Adventure boye cannot be stopped 
That pen is now an accessory. 
Dog: cage move??? cage move. I move. MOOOOVE

Dogs aren't stupid.  My mom had our dog in the front yard with her once when she was doing yard work, there was no fence and she didn't want her wandering off so she put her leash on her and tossed the loop over a sprinkler so the dog couldn't wander off.  The dog simple walked over, picked up her leash off the sprinkler and then walked over to my mom.

Clearly this person thought their plan through just as much as my mom did. 
Who would put a dog in such a tiny pen anyway  :( 
Dog immediately goes to other humans to get pets 
Dogs are perfect

This is as old as it is good 
Thank you eyebleach. You make my day so much better every time I see one of your gifs. 
FENTON! 
*Initial D music* 
/u/JavaReallySucks  Dude your entire posting history is just you re-posting the same exact thing on multiple subreddits.

Do we need to talk? Why do you feel the need to do this? 
Someone call the foundation! We have a containment breach!  
I'm not locked in here with you. You are locked in here with me.

Can I ask? Do you ever shave this dog? 
...he looks contained to me 
Comin' out of my cage and I've been doing just fine! 
This dog taught me everything i need to know about life. 
Well, that's kind of a small pen for that size of a pupper. 

Maybe a larger pen, or a crate instead? Just a thought from a fellow dog lover.

‘NO PRISON CAN HOLD ME’

-the dog, probably  
Fuck I love this gif,  
I'm going to start saving popular posts and reposting them weeks later for th free karma 
I love that he put his nose trough the corner portion of the pen so that he can maneuver better.

JUST LOOK HOW HE TURNS THAT CORNER!

*When an introvert just wants to be alone.* 
That desperate "gotcha!" style catch suggests they've been chasing this bandit for a while 
I just can't get you out of my head 
Boy your loving is all I think about  
It goes around the world
Just, la la la la la
It's all around the world
Just, la la la la la
And everybody's singing
La la la la la
And now the bells are ringing 
And den he move his cage and he get dis.  
Bulldog was definitely escape-pups lookout  
Reminds me of the beginning of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. 
Thank you for an alternative to "lol" when I haven't actually laughed, but really did "smile so hard."  
A fine real-life example of "it's not a bug, it's a feature" 
Ha ha - that is hilarious! 
I optimistically assume that they sat the dog there for a few seconds to grab something and it just started to walk away. 
gonna get you like a space boye 
Hair trims are acceptable but outside of butt hair and toe hair that’s just their breed. The hair doesn’t really get knotted so unless you live somewhere super hot or need to for another reason it’s almost cruel to shave them.  
I would be so happy to see this while doing my laundry. I wouldn’t be mad at all, let the box puppy bump into things. 
I read that in Clarkson’s voice. 
“Here the pupper comes around Gambon, JUST LOOK HOW HE TURNS THAT CORNER! And across the line. He’s the best boi....in the world.”

Thank you for sharing.

I hope so! I am not against penning your dog for whatever reason but that size is just ridiculous - apparently the dog agrees  :) 
Hell, I would visit that laundromat just to see that dog. Make him the mascot or something. 
It's not a laundromat, it's a pet store.  Of course, it wasn't until the 5th or 6th time through that I realized that!  
I see you everywhere dude 
LITERALLY THIS xD 
Shank you for caring. 
The place is a dog cafe in korea. Its where you take your dogs for them to socialize with other dogs, and random people can come and go to play with them as well, for a price.

These places usually host some of their own dogs and the cafe owners are mostly great caretakers - although there must be bad ones out there too. 

Regarding your concern, it Depends on cafe to cafe but usually dogs can roam freely, or freely inside a large areas dedicated to dogs.

Fore more of your infomation, there are cat cafes too :) 
I went to one that had a bird that was obsessed with me (one of the little yellow/green ones) and the attendant couldn't get him into the cage but kept having to shoo him away from trying to land on me cause it would freak me out (not a bird person)

This cat is completely indifferent to the attention.

This cat is a cat. 
Can cats have such a vivid blue eyes? 
The most beautiful cat I have ever seen... 
The spice must flow. 
Pretty sure this cat is some Nordic god. 
this cat is prettier than me

Just don’t tell him winter is coming 
That's a rare cat.  
SO PRETTYYYYY

It's nice to see such an otherworldly and beautiful cat will still tell you to fuck right off with that camera. 
GODS I WAS GORGEOUS THEN 
Racist 
Complete stab in the dark, but I wanna say it's blind. 
I'm not sure, I wonder if there are any pictures of gifs that show such eyes on the internet. Then we'll know. 
Complete stab in the dark but this is heavily edited. Source: I’m a video editor and do this to my own cats eyes.

Also the video is overexposed so the brightness of the eyes would be much higher than what you’d see in real life. 
I was thinking the same thing. It didn't seem to really notice the camera and it's pupils don't seem to change at all. 
I thought that meant they were deaf?
