That looks nothing like a finger. 
I would be very interested in seeing a sped-up video of her doing a painting like that. 
If she painted this with her fingers doesn't that make it a digital picture? 
Looks like giving your dog a bath while on LSD. 
She has her many many more of these ‘shakin dogs’ http://www.irisscottfineart.com/shakin-dogs/ 
For the first moment, I just assumed it was a lady trying to keep herself from getting water shaken onto her by an especially large dog 
Babe Ross 
Bob Ross type show?   Teach us to make happy accidents on canvas.  
Yeah! Picked up the dog, dipped him into paint, and delicately flung him against the canvass with her gloved fingers.  
Incredible work, must take a lot of finger prints. 
That pinky toe though 
looks like alia shawkat 
I want Jeff Goldblum to sell me one of these 
The fact that she paint the picture just by using her fingers is so amazing. Very talented artist. 
And that children. Is how the universe was created. 
Where does one buy a canvas that big 
I wonder if she sells... prints. 
Wow looks amazing great movement  
There are so many amazing painting posts on Reddit and all of them make me feel so incompetent coz I know I will never be able to make anything remotely as good.  
These paintings are all over my vets office in Brooklyn! Love them! 
>Brush manufacturers hate her.  You won't believe this mom's secret for making amazing paintings. 
Felt like I was getting drenched just looking at ths.

Well done lady painter woman  
ELI5...how do artists take an original on a canvas that size and then are able to reproduce prints of it to sell? Generally curious. 
10/10 painting 1/10 finger painting  
Very good. 
So cool 
Damn

I keep seeing pictures like this and I'm starting to feel like if any of the fat people I know decided to lose weight I wouldn't recognize their faces anymore.

Edit: A passing thought became my most upvoted comment by a huge margin. Thanks Reddit! 
9/10 would take to olive garden. 
Not to be confused with [Two friends who got fat together] (https://i.imgur.com/5ISNvR5.jpg) 
The girl in the flower dress did a good job, but clearly she's been skipping left leg day 
Surely they’re sisters  
LPT: If you're already skinny and want karma, take a selfie, get really fat, take another selfie, then pass them off as before and after pictures. 
Good on them for getting fit and healthy. 
They did a great fucking job! They look like two entirely different people  
Why are so many of these pictures on the front page? 
They're actually sisters, not friends. I went to high school with them and there were the sweetest girls. So glad to see them looking amazing! 
They did this by switching their diet up a little bit. They were consuming somewhere in the ballpark of 3500 calories daily and it took its toll. After a trip to the doctor who gave them an ultimatum "get your eating habits on track or your health is going to suffer" they decided to make the change. Luckily the one girl has a super supportive father and he invented something for them to eat. Peanut butter and graham cracker sandwiches.  
From White Castle to White Chicks. 
I feel like this pic is stolen from somewhere cause they're definitely genetically related. 
As a former obese guy, being a healthy weight and in decent shape is fucking awesome. 

No joke that people treat you better, the opposite sex pays more attention, I can take the stairs if I don't feel like riding in the elevators and beat people in the lobby to my floor, I workout in an office gym and doing weighted pullups is practically showing off, I can hustle to beat a crosswalk as a pedestrian and not even breath hard, clothes fit better, I can eat whatever i want and the worst thing anyone can say is "how do you eat that and not gain weight" like it's fucking magic 

The list goes on. And it's all on top of not having bad joints and heart problems.  
Plot twist: 

After | Before 
I lost 77 pounds (35kg) over the last 18 months. It’s literally two of my 3 year old toddlers worth of weight.  
ITT: guys who like "bigger" girls.  
Super fit or not, everyone always looks so much more attractive when they have a slimmer face. Nice job to these two. 
Props to these two. Best part, they both look confident and happy in both pictures! Congrats on your success!  
I kinda like the fat slutty versions better.   
Ugh I am going in the opposite direction. 
It's great to see friends helping each other achieving their goals 
I like em bigger lol 
I bet they just got locked in one-uping each other.   Like one of them was like "That bitch lost 5lbs....I'll show her..."


 
I am a chubby chaser 
You gals look great and congratulations on your American teeth. 
Nice job ladies. You put years on your life.  
Out of curiosity, the chick on the left has got two different pair of legs, is it common?

The knee is also missing 
They look pretty in both the before and after, but congratulations to them on getting healthier.
This seems like such a bullshit "nice" comment, but I actually mean it. lol
