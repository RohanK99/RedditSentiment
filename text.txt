Saw this on the news. The basic story was these two soldiers were pinned down in Vietnam on New year's Eve. They made a pact that if they got out they would meet again every year. This was one of them standing guard for their final meeting. 
I read the article. This was a friendship made in Vietnam. 
>On New Year’s Eve 1968, just before the dawn of 1969, Master Sgt. William H. Cox and his buddy First Sgt. James T. Hollingsworth were holed up in a bunker in the Marble Mountains of Vietnam.

>Rockets and mortars were raining down all around them, or as Cox puts it, “Charlie (the nickname for the North Vietnamese) was really putting on a fireworks show for us.”

>As they hunkered down, the two Marines made a pact: “If we survived this attack, or survived Vietnam, we would contact each other every year on New Year’s,” Cox recalled.

>For nearly five decades, Cox, who lives in Piedmont, and Hollingsworth, whose nickname was Hollie, kept their promise to each other.

>And earlier this year, Cox kept another promise: He stood guard at Hollingsworth’s casket and then delivered the eulogy at his funeral.

Hes standing "parade rest" and its similar to what happens in war.  When soldiers die they are never left alone or never left behind, whichever way you want to look at it.  Someone keeps watch until they are buried.  Even when the deceased is in flight from over seas, a soldier is there escorting them home.  Usually ive only seen it with active duty deaths.  Passing after retirement, soldiers will come to the funeral, do the multi gun salute and the flag folding ceremony etc...  these guys must have been through some shit together.  I think its a battle buddy seeing his brother off as well. 
First Louie DeBrusk watching his kid score lead to visiting /r/happycryingdads then the Santa doing sign language, now this?  Reddit has made me an emotional wreck this morning.

Edit: DeBrusk, not debris 
My father passed away in 2016. He was a 22 year veteran who served in WWII, Korea, and during Vietnam, although he stayed in the U.S.during that one. He retired and served another 10 years as an ROTC instructor. At his funeral 3 men came up to my mother and introduced themselves as 3 of his students from the 70s. One had traveled from Washington State just to be there. He was a retired full bird colonel who told my mom that my dad had literally been the difference in his life, and that he wouldn't be the man he was without him. I'm tearing up as I write this, and am so proud to have known my father. Just thought I'd share here since this reminded me of my dad, a soldier until the end. 
We're losing a lot of generations of vets fast. If you'd like to get to know more vets I'd suggest volunteering at the VA or another vet project. 

https://www.volunteer.va.gov

I'd also suggest if you know of a WW2, Korean, or Vietnam vet that you encourage them to do Honor Flight where they'll be able to visit Washington D.C. to see the monuments and when they return most places have an airport full of people to clap and cheer for the veterans.

Fucking rah. I may have placed myself far from the Marine Corps after I got out, but this shit brought a tear to my eye. When someone calls you 'brother' or 'sister', and is willing to lay down their life for yours, that's something fucking special. Not just in the military, but life in general. 

Excuse me while I go cry. 
No such thing as a former marine. 
People forget that this is America, it’s what makes us. I don’t mean necessarily war, but the length many of us will go for a stranger. It’s our identity. I’ll give you the shirt off my back if you need it, but not if you’re trying to take it from me.  
I read somewhere that this man normally used a cane but refused to do so when watching over his buddy. So much honor and dedication to camaraderie in one human being and I guarantee it would’ve been the same way had roles been reversed.  
Master sargeant or gunny?

Edit: He's a Master Gunnery Sargeant. The guy has seen some shit. Much respect.

Edit 2: As pointed out, Master Sargeant. Still, *oohrah !* 
My grandfather was in the 4th Marine Division during WWII. When he passed, Marines came and did the gun salute, folded the flag, whole nine yards. It was impressive. He served 70 years ago, and they still came. I was lucky enough to know him well and he was one of those guys who didn't mind talking about it every now and then. Lots of crazy stories I could never imagine living through. He watched his friends die and killed men, and I'm bitching about a dude pulling out in front of me. Really puts shit into perspective.  
That’s what loyalty looks like.  
Semper Fi my brothers.  
Semper Fidelis friend.  
Semper Fi .  
My grandfather died a couple years back and had served following WWII, in Germany as they were rebuilding. His many friends who had either served with him or served and had gotten to know him later asked to carry him out of the church to his plot. These men ranged across conflicts and in age between 65 and 85, and though it wasn't easy for them to carry the casket, they saw it as their final duty to him.  
We just buried my father in law yesterday, and this picture (aside from the friend standing vigil) reminds me of the day. The graveside ceremony was performed by 3 extremely old ex-military. The reading of the meaning of each fold in the flag was so moving. I’d never heard it, and I couldn’t hold back my tears. But, when they handed it off to my husband my heart exploded. 

For all of the madness going on, I love my country so much. Hearing taps played, seeing flyovers and the national anthem sung, or men/women in uniform during ceremony always fills me with emotion.  

And, yesterday we put to rest a beautiful man who served in both WWII and North Korea. 

Rest well now, Pop.  
I was on funeral honors for a while and that was pretty taxing emotionally. I can only imagine how rough it is to stand watch over a friend.   
Shit.

My grandfather was in ww2 - as a bubble gunner/ball turret operator on a few different aircraft.   At his funeral,  his best friend from the war, 'shorty ', stood up from his wheelchair and saluted while 'amazing grace' was played on bagpipes...  it was one of the saddest things I've ever witnessed.  
Semper Fi, Devil Dog 
r/USMC 
Wow this hits home. Loosing a brother in arms is such a heart breaking feeling. I lost my best friend in April. He was 36. Being the only other soldier at his funeral was hard for me. I gave him his final salute and let him to rest. Stupid reddit.  Now I have to go chop onions.  Miss you so much Jeremy.  
Fuckin rah 
Semper Fidelis 
Motivating! Semper Fi!  
Semper Fi to both of you.  
For those who disagree with the Vietnam war, or just the armed forces in in general, one thing to note.

You don't have to respect the forces, or indeed the reasons we go to war, but the bonds servicemen such as these forge in hugely awful circumstances are worthy and deserving of respect and compassion.

It looks cool but isn't it dangerous being this close? 
Could you feel the heat radiating? 
It's all fuckin fun and games until this shit happens:

In another era you would be a revered and powerful medicine man.  
Amazing photo! Do you have any more later into the eruption?  
Are you on Santa Maria?  
If an eruption lasts longer than four hours consult your geologist immediately. 
Quit being a pussy and try that on the mountain behind you 
Krakatoaaaa! 
That looks metal AF!  
Woah! This is an amazing picture! Great job. Was the eruption loud? 
Man, the planets had to align for this shot. 
AMAZING!  Great pic! 
Where and when? 
No way, seriously, is this real rn? 
Cant tell if this is Volcan Pacaya, near Antigua or not. Looks like it though. 
Everybody's commenting on OP being too close....are we just gonna ignore the fact that there are other people way closer that look like lava is literally about to drip down on? 
I was in Guatemala years ago and got to see a volcano erupt too. I was much further away, but it was amazing to watch.  
Go throw the ring in Frodo! 
*Welcome to Earth!* 
That’s not Venus that’s a star! 
I would have made it look like i was farting. 
What an amazing place 
It looks freighting and cool at the same time.  
Your scientists all agree, what you thought was a UFO, was, in fact, Venus. 
Damn venus, thought that was some dust on my screen, wiped it like 4 times.. 
I love this pic, I’m ERUPTING with awe.  
Venus, or, a dead pixel. 
Waiting for the next pic where he gets hit by a rock.  Unless perhaps the rock hit the guy with the camera.

I would be very interested in seeing a sped-up video of her doing a painting like that. 
Looks like giving your dog a bath while on LSD. 
That looks nothing like a finger. 
If she painted this with her fingers doesn't that make it a digital picture? 
She has many many more of these ‘shakin dogs’ http://www.irisscottfineart.com/shakin-dogs/ 
For the first moment, I just assumed it was a lady trying to keep herself from getting water shaken onto her by an especially large dog 
Bob Ross type show?   Teach us to make happy accidents on canvas.  
Babe Ross 
That pinky toe though 
Yeah! Picked up the dog, dipped him into paint, and delicately flung him against the canvass with her gloved fingers.  
Incredible work, must take a lot of finger prints. 
And that children. Is how the universe was created. 
looks like alia shawkat 
I want Jeff Goldblum to sell me one of these 
I paint a wall in my bathroom and I’m a sweaty ass paint covered train wreck. She paints a 20 ft full color masterpiece and looks like a hot chick with a spot on her apron.  
I wonder if she sells... prints. 
These paintings are all over my vets office in Brooklyn! Love them! 
ELI5...how do artists take an original on a canvas that size and then are able to reproduce prints of it to sell? Generally curious. 
I've seen those finger paintings you bring home and they suck!  
I'd let her finger paint me. 
Where does one buy a canvas that big 
Wow. I wonder if that's why she does large canvases, because her definition is limited to her smallest finger. Or does she also fling paint at it? 
That pinky toe tho😳 
My high school art teacher gave us an assignment in class to paint a picture of a tree each one of us had sketched, and he could choose "whatever way [we] want" to paint the picture. I chose to finger paint. I wasnt trying to do it to be funny, or to be clever and use her words against her, I genuinely wanted to try to create a good quality (I mean for high school) finger painting, and she shot me down as she walked around the class and saw me using my fingers. Said it "wasn't real art" to use your fingers. We got into an argument about what "real art" was and she gave me detention. I wish I could send this picture to her. 
So cool 
Wow looks amazing great movement  
There are so many amazing painting posts on Reddit and all of them make me feel so incompetent coz I know I will never be able to make anything remotely as good.  
Felt like I was getting drenched just looking at ths.

Well done lady painter woman  
I bet she's funny as hell.

Bentonville Arkansas 21st century hotel is where this is located  
It's rumored that the tree is watered by the tears of basketball players who couldn't continue playing after Shaq broke the rim.  
>Backboard 
And the legend says that he still hasn't made a free throw in to a single one of those hoops to this day.  
She's magnificent 
That's one amazing rim job! 
That is one tall tree. 
It's like the shrike's tree of thorns. 
So does he get to keep the hoops when he breaks the backboard? Seems to me that would just encourage breaking them.  
So...what does he say? “Even though the rim isn’t broken i want it”. So now they have to replace the backboard and the rim. Or do they just throw it all away and he goes dumpster diving after the game?  
Do you want me to pass it?? 
All those hoops and he still misses the free thow 
God's he was strong.  
How tall would the tree grow
with every missed free throw?
 
Modern art at its finest 
Looks like a fun game to play 
If I were him I probably would have done something like this too. 
..congratulations on being so big shaq, completely unskilled basketball player but a really big guy. 
Reminds me of the rocking chair the Minnesota Twins gave to Mariano Rivera as a retirement gift [made from broken bats.](http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/minnesota-twins-mariano-rivera-rocking-chair-broken.jpg) 
Were most of those in high school? I don't remember him breaking a ton in college or NBA. I count at least 18 on that tree. I only remember like 5 or 6 times he busted a backboard. 
You know that Shaq posted it as a joke right?  It's just a piece of art and has nothing to do with him. 
I feel like this doesn't make any sense.  
Wow I just moved here, and have seen this, but never knew it had anything to do with Shaq. 
Lived not far from Bentonville for a few years now and never knew this was here 
21c 
When Shaq breaks your rim, it’s stays broke 
Wasn’t sure whether I’d get flack for putting backboard, or hoop. So I went with hoop. 
Yeah, I wondered about that. I didn’t see a single broken hoop there. 
One of them was responsible for Shaq's one...ONE three pointer in his career. Per ESPN Stats:

"Shaq made exactly one three-pointer out of 22 attempts in regular and post-season games over his entire career. His one made three was in a regular-season game in the 1995-96 season, when he was with Orlando."
