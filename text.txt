Very original definitely not stolen 
I have only seen this for the 7th time 
Jokes aside, having a phobia of chainsaws would be different: You would become disturbed even at the sound of chainsaws, or possibly even digital images or videos. 
Chainsaws are fun as fuck.

Nah, he wouldn t get the job just off of that...

Now if he d charged $100 for page 2, then it might be a different story...

Or if the interviewer just read page 1 for 40 hours, that might do the trick too. 
It s $5

In the 7 years I have been paying for internet, never once have I had an outage. But believe me, when the world ends I ll spend the first 25 minuets wondering why the internet is not working.  
I will be the minority......but I actually miss shows like that. Michael Landon was a legend.  
I never thought I'd see the day Little House On The Prairie made it to Reddit

But everyone is gonna do destroy dick December  
Well no-one does "no fap November" that's for sure, cuz everyone is doing "no nut November" 
Do people really care whether others don't fap or not? It got even sillier when it became "no-nut-November". If you wanna stain your bed sheets with your wet dreams, then go ahead! Your body will find a way to unload it.

Not all who wander are truly lost.... 
He's not physically lost he emotionally lost, drifting through life purposelessly we must help this dogoo find his purpose 
Probably smells his owners or home

I don't understand the context, explain please. 
Thank you! 
It's basically the infamous and controvertial mission in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called "No Russian", but instead of "No Russian" it's "NO POMEGRANATES!". 
In the game  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 , there is a mission where you terrorize a mall. In the beginning, they say  Remember, No Russian . In the recent video, there is a teacher yelling at the students saying  No Pomegranates!

You screwed up on the last ur and actually wrote "your" 
Also why u can t feel ur harbles anymore. 
Cause you hate spiders? 
It's called Minnesota.  Ww do it because it's amazing when the air isn't paint stripping your face.   
Because there s no mosquitoes 
"Why does my face hurt so much? And where in the hell am I?" 
Better question: Why do I live somewhere where the air hurts your face half the year but mosquitoes still feast on your flesh the other half? Because John Adams is from here? Guy couldn t even become the first president.
